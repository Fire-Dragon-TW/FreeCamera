# Freecam
This mod allows you to view your world from a spectator-like perspective. It can be useful for previewing builds and exploring your world. It works in multiplayer, but may be considered cheating on some servers, so use at your own risk.

The bind defaults to X, and can be changed in the vanilla options menu. Speed and various cosmetic options are configurable through the Mod Menu config page.
