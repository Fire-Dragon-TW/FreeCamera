# Freecam
This mod allows you to view your world from a spectator-like perspective. While it is enabled, you can fly around and travel through blocks. Disabling it will restore you to your original position. This can be useful for quickly previewing builds and exploring your world. It works in multiplayer, but may be considered cheating on some servers, so use it at your own risk.

The bind defaults to X, and can be changed in the vanilla options menu. Speed and various cosmetic options are configurable through the Mod Menu config page.
